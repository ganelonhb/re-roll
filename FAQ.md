# FAQ

*Nobody actually asked me these questions. You get the idea.*

**Q: Does this program come with any random encounters?**

The program does not come shipped with any pre-written random encounter scenarios, however I intend to eventually
upload another GitHub Repo with some prewritten scenarios.

**Q: How does this program generate random encounters?**

This program does not generate any text. This program simply traverses a directory and searches for .txt files,
then outputs the contents of one random file. It is a tool to automate rolling from multiple, large libraries of
pre-written random encounters. You therefore still have to provide your own set of encounters in the described
form (see [README.md](https://github.com/ganelonhb/re-roll/blob/master/README.md)).

**Q: Where can I find tables of random encounters that are compatible with this program?**

Unless someone generously provides you with such a thing, you will have to figure that out yourself. I intend to
eventually provide a seperate repo you can download with the random encounters I have written for my own games,
but until I've done so you will have to write them yourself.

I would reccomend using a program like vim or nano for a quick command-line workflow, but I understand that not
everyone is a sick f\*cking beast like me and needs a quick and painless download.
